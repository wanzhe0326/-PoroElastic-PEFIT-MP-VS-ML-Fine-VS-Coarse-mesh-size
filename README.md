Zipped file 1. Poroelastic PEFIT 800 x 89, mesh size dx =1, dy=0.5  (1.1 ML; 1.2 MP 1.3 MP soft landing)

Zipped file 2. Poroelastic PEFIT 800 x 89, mesh size dx =0.5, dy=0.5 (2.1 ML; 2.2 MP 2.3 MP soft landing)

Zipped file 3. Poroelastic PEFIT 800 x 89, mesh size dx =1, dy=1 (3.1 ML; 3.2 MP 3.3 MP soft landing)

Zipped file 3.1. Poroelastic PEFIT 1600 x 89, mesh size dx =1, dy=1 (3.1.1 ML; 3.1.2 MP 3.1.3 MP soft landing)

AB parameter: 0.00045; loading/unloading: 10E-03; load moves forward two grids at one time.

Results: By comparing ML VS MP to check if there is bug in system. Also, different mesh sizes are tested, total computational time and accuracy are compared.
